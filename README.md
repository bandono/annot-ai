# Intro

This simple project creates embedding for later search from the book annotations created in [kobo-annot-import](https://github.com/bandono/kobo-annot-import). It's based on [example in OpenAI Cookbook](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/Embedding_Wikipedia_articles_for_search.ipynb)

# Not Sized for AI

I'm annotating the books while reading them, hence the size of the data is quite small for AI. (213 files)

Most AI employs annotation, so think of this as the meta for those books.

# Parts

The first part will read the annotations and store them as embedding. While the second part is for search (retrieval) of knowledge.
